# Web components for graphics education

## Abstract

In the field of computer graphics there are several concepts that can be difficult to assimilate for
students. Some of them fail to understand the ideas presented in lectures. Then they are at a
loss when it comes to applying their knowledge to graphics programming.
<br/>
Since this field is intrinsically visual, the inclusion of interactive programs could make easier the
acquisition of knowledge for students. These programs would allow students to represent
different problems and experiment with different configurations.
<br/>
This project aims to help the [FIB](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en) in teaching of computer graphics. For this reason, a series of
interactive programs are created to show some of the most difficult concepts in computer
graphics programming. These programs are developed as independent web components that
can be loaded into a webpage and/or added to another webpage that already has other
elements

## Demo
